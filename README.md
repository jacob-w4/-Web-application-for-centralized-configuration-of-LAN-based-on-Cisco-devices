## Name
Web application for centralized configuration of LAN based on Cisco devices
## Description
The aim of the work is to create a functional web application that will enable the user to create a computer network structure, add devices and configure them remotely from a web browser via a GUI. The application assumes the ability to configure basic functions of network devices (e.g. interface/port configuration, vlan creation and management, routing) and advanced functions (e.g. creation and management of ACLs, Port Security, DHCP, NAT, EtherChannel). The application will allow the creation and restoration of configuration backups and connection tests (ping, SSH/Telnet access check).
